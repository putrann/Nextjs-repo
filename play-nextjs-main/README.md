[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)]


```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
**Note:** As of right now React 19 causes peer dependencies issues with some packages, so the `legacy-peer-deps` flag is required.

4. Now you're ready to start the project on your local server. Use the following command to get it up and running:

```bash
    npm run dev
 ```

This will launch the template on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
